# Shooting by Wolf

This is a bakkesmod plugin designed similarly to Aim Training by Coco, where the target is a specific part of the net. 

The idea is to use this in a training pack or freeplay, where the shots can theoretically be varied and give more situations to train.

I wrote the game management, but I also used previously developed resources:
    - //  Rendering Tools by CinderBlocc: https://github.com/CinderBlocc/RenderingTools/blob/master/
    - I used Martinii89's Bakkesmod Template: https://github.com/Martinii89/BakkesmodPluginTemplateV2
